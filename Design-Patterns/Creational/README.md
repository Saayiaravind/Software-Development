# What are Creational Design Patterns
A set of patterns to help manage the complexity of gorwing programming logic.

There are two main themes that are common to most creational design patterns.
1) They encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system should use.
2) They conceal how objects are created. Abstracting this information makes the code much more flexible.
The system is much less constrained about what gets created and the how's and when's too.
